# Differential-Gene-Expression-and-Neuromelanin
Utilizing gene expression data to characterize the formation of neuromelanin in the brain

Check out the documentation files to see all the code with comments above and below code chunks to get a better idea of the project as a whole, as well as  reference to the scientific papers used in this project and a conclusion of the overall results. One file is the original RMarkdown file used for documentation, and another is a pdf of the same file that includes the output of the code. I've also linked the presentation slideshow for reference, although the documentation files are more detailed overall.

all_code.R contains all the code from the documentation file in one R script.
